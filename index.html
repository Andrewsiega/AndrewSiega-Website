        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Andrew Siega. I am 26 years old. I am currently on my third year attending UC Riverside. 
        I currently live in Sacramento, California. I am not currently employed, as i am a full time student.
        My hometown is in South San Francisco, California. I moved from my hometown to Sacramento in 2005 when I was around 11 years old.
        I graduated from Inderkum High School in 2012 and went to Sac City College. I attended for only a year and took a break to work more hours at my first job.
        My first job was at Mountain Mikes Pizza and worked there from 2013 until the end of 2014 when i got my second job.
        My second job was at Fedex Express at the Sacramento International Airport where I would load packages and contains into the planes.
        Then, in 2016 I transferred to a part time delivery driving position at another location within Sacramento.<br><br>
        In 2017, i decided to go back to college and attended Woodland Community College.
        By the beginning of 2020, was my last semester there and my classes schedule had a conflict with my work schedule.
        I thought it would be an issue with no soltuion besides to quit my job, I refused to quit school again as I was already close to finishing.
        Luckily, my manager had informed me he could modify my work schedule for me to be able to still work and finish school.
        Unfortunately, he could not keep his word and was then told i had to either choose to quit school to be able to keep my job or quit my job.
        So i chose to quit my job and put all my focus into finishing school.
        I graduated in 2020 with an Associates Degree in Social and Behavior Science and transferred to UC Riverside.
        However, since the economy is in a pandemic I am still in Sacramento while attending online classes.<br><br>

        I am working towards achieving a Bachalor's Degree in Sociology and plan to finish in Spring 2022.
        Depending on when public opens up again, I am assuming that I will be finishing school from home as well.
        That isn't much an issue to as it does benefit me a lot.
        I don't have to worry about getting a job or paying rent thanks to my parents, and it allows me to have full focus on school.
        If I do end up finishing school from home, I still have plans on moving to Riverside or somewhere within Southern California and find a job out there.
        If things go well as planned, i may also continue into grad school.
